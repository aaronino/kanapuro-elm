# Kanapuro in Elm

This is the learning application Kanapuro in Elm. Uses Vite for build tooling and tailwind for styling.

Kanapuro will help teach you Hiragana and Katakana by introducing characters slowly and with repetition. The software will be sure to challenge you on the kana you need the most practice on, ensuring you're not wasting time with information you've already mastered. There are also multiple methods available to practice, making sure you're familiar with the kana in multiple environments.
